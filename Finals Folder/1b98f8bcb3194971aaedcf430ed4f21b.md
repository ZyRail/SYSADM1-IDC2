client databases and proprietary threat intelligence. The recovery disk
strategy aimed to provide a swift and effective response in the face of
a cybersecurity crisis. When the malware attack unfolded, the IT
security team at TechGuard Solutions swiftly used the recovery disks.

Booting the infected workstations in an isolated environment prevented
the malware from spreading further within the company\'s network. The
recovery disks, equipped with decryption tools specific to the
ransomware, played a critical role in decrypting and restoring files
from offline backups. The inclusion of offline backups on the recovery
disks proved pivotal in ensuring data protection during the ransomware
attack. With redundant copies of critical client data stored offline,
