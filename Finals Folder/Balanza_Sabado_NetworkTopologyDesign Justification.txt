Network Analysis

This network topology analyses and provides solutions for possible problems, such as capacity and security issues. In this design, the systems such as the database server, web server, application server, email server, security server, and caching server are replicated so that the chances of downtime are reduced while services are guaranteed even at peak times. Within the core layer, there are multilayer switches that support high-level routing for inter-VLAN communication and assist in traffic dispersion. In addition, traffic types, including user access traffic, database queries, and administrative traffic, will be segmented via the VLAN segmentation so as to enhance performance while reducing traffic bottlenecks. In addition, the redundancy and fault tolerance in the system improves reliability and capacity in times of high traffic, especially during peak hours.

Scalability Planning

This design supports both vertical and horizontal scaling making it highly scalable, which means adding additional servers and devices requires no significant structural changes. In addition, managing increasing user loads would become easier because VLANs on the network help separate traffic logically. Additionally, the availability of backup servers for every server on the network offers redundancy. Core and access layer switches are also offered as additional port capacity in case of expansion. Generally, this topology will make sure that the network is growing along with the demand for the website at peak hours, and even after, it balances the traffic through multiple paths with high performance.

Evaluation of Solutions

The network design specified has thorough scalability approaches. The multilayer switches can be used to assist in efficient traffic and inter-VLAN processes routing, and firewalls protect systems from DDoS attacks. Requests are distributed among the servers by load balancers, so this prevents server overload and guarantees efficient utilization. The next generation of switches with high-bandwidth uplinks also enhances the design by preparing it for future increasing traffic. The setup costs and complexity are indeed moderately high in the early stages but the overall gain in reliability, security, and performance later on justifies the investment.

Proposed Design

The network diagram shows that the design has been meticulously structured and well-reasoned. The collapsed core layer reduces complexity while maintaining redundancy in the form of dual multilayered switches that manage the traffic routing and provide seamless failover functionality. The servers have dedicated backup supports to protect the services from any data loss and delivery interruption. The edge layer switches allow connection between the servers and client systems while supporting VLANs to provide logical segregation of traffic. Such a multilayered mechanism offers several benefits such as effective traffic management, fault tolerance, and security, which the e-commerce site will definitely require during peak hour traffic.

Evaluation and Justification

With this design, reliability, scalability, and security are guaranteed while handling expected traffic spikes for the e-commerce site. Deployment of redundant core switches and backup servers for all core services reduces the risk of system downtime and increased fault tolerance. VLANs ensure traffic segregation and enforce bandwidth for the services, thereby ensuring that quality is maintained even at times of extremes. The application of firewalls as well as DDoS protection also enhances the security of the network and shields it from external threats, thus maintaining data integrity and availability. The investment cost that is associated with the design in terms of the devices and redundancy may be high, but the benefits in terms of supporting intersect volumes of use are also significantly greater. The additional complexity that VLAN and multilayer switch configuration add is well worth the improvement in performance and scalability. This design greatly takes care of customer concerns even when there are high levels of traffic during the system integration phase and allows more business growth in the future as well.
