Network Analysis

In the old network design case, Layer 2 switches directly connect to VLAN1, VLAN2, and VLAN3. All these switches are connected to the multilayer switch's central device. The multilayer switch centralizes the entire network before it is connected to the edge router that leads to the internet. The good thing about VLANS is that they provide logical separation in traffic for managing and reducing broadcast domains. However, the size of the multilayer switch must be such that it does not become a choke point for all these VLANs. The same applies when considering uplinks from layer 2 switches towards core devices; enough bandwidth should be available so that no congestions occur at any time. Looking at the security of the network, it has no firewalls or other security measures included into it. Therefore, if there is no proper policy implemented or ACL in place then the network can easily get jeopardized by external oluses or internally among each other. Another issue that may pose a growing hindrance to the scalability of this network occurs if Layer 2 switches run out of ports or if an edge switch cannot handle an increased traffic load due to expansion in size for example through the acquisition of additional sites by the organization. Additionally, the servers are standalone with no backup allowing the possibility of downtime, especially during peak hours.

Scalability Planning

This design supports both vertical and horizontal scaling making it highly scalable, which means adding additional servers and 
devices requires no significant structural changes. In addition, managing increasing user loads would become easier because VLANs on the network help separate traffic 
logically. Additionally, the availability of backup servers for every server on the network offers redundancy. Core and access layer switches are also offered as 
additional port capacity in case of expansion. Generally, this topology will make sure that the network is growing along with the demand for the website at 
peak hours, and even after, it balances the traffic through multiple paths with high performance.

Evaluation of Solutions

The network design specified has thorough scalability approaches. Multilayer switches ensure efficient traffic management and inter-VLAN process routing, 
and firewalls protect systems from DDoS attacks. Requests are distributed among the servers by load balancers, so this prevents server overload and guarantees 
efficient utilization. The next generation of switches with high-bandwidth uplinks also enhances the design by preparing it for future increasing traffic. 
While initial setup costs and complexity are moderately high, the long-term improvements in reliability, security, and performance justify the investment.

Proposed Design

This updated network design topology will increase scalability and reliability to further improve the performance of the e-commerce website.  The collapsed core layer introduces redundancy and high-speed interconnections between network devices, ensuring uninterrupted operations during high demand or equipment failure. This ensures uninterrupted operation even through durations of excessive calls for or equipment failure. Dual firewalls (Firewall1 and Firewall2) hook up with multiple ISPs and twin routers (Router5 and Router6) for Internet access. Provides robust load balancing competencies to make certain non-stop availability.
Multiple switches are used to efficaciously distribute the community load on the access layer. Every server Including web server utility Database server and storage server has a dedicated backup server This ensures that vital services continue to be functional in the event of hardware or software program failure. Separation of various varieties of servers into unique regions (e.G. Community, packages, safety, storage, and database server) facilitates growth aid allocation and improves efficiency. Using interconnected switches increases scalability. This allows the network to expand as needed.
Overall, the proposed layout correctly addresses the restrictions of the preceding setup. By combining redundant resources load balancing and particular backups
collectively These modifications have been optimized to support the increasing needs of e-commerce websites. Even all through rush hour and guarantees maximum efficiency

Evaluation and Justification

This design ensures reliability, scalability, and security while addressing expected traffic spikes. Redundant core switches and backup servers minimize downtime and enhance fault tolerance. 
VLANs logically segment traffic and allocate bandwidth efficiently, maintaining quality even during high loads. Firewalls and DDoS protection enhance security, safeguarding data 
integrity and availability. Although the initial investment is significant, the benefits—reliability, scalability, and capacity to support business growth—outweigh the costs. 
The complexity added by VLANs and multilayer switches is justified by the resulting improvements in performance and scalability, ensuring the system meets both current and future needs.
